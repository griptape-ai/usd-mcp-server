Tool Docs
=========

Conventions
- All tools are single-action, minimal inputs/outputs.
- Responses use `{ ok, result?, error? }`.
- `stage_id` is a short token created by the server.
- Time values use a USD timeCode number or the string `"default"`.

Autogeneration
- Tier docs will later be generated from Python schemas. For now, Tier 0 is hand-written.
